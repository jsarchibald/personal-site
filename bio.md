This summer, I am excited to serve as a software engineering intern through the [Civic Digital Fellowship](https://www.codingitforward.com/civic-digital-fellowship), a technology internship program that gives innovative students the opportunity to solve pressing problems in federal agencies.

I previously worked as a research assistant at the [Creative Computing Lab](https://creativecomputing.gse.harvard.edu/) at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where I worked on tools to analyze [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) projects and helped develop a website for the [Getting Unstuck](https://gettingunstuck.gse.harvard.edu/) professional development program.

Last summer I worked as a software development intern at [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/), helping to design software tools to improve the student experience for Harvard's introductory computer science course. I've previously worked as a Teaching Fellow for the course in both its undergraduate and law school iterations.

Outside of class, I enjoy volunteering my time teaching in Boston Public Schools - I taught American government as part of the [Harvard CIVICS](https://iop.harvard.edu/get-involved/civics-program) program for my first three semesters of college and recently served as the president of the [Digital Literacy Project](https://digilit.io/), which teaches middle school computer science.

I took a leave of absence from Harvard for the Spring 2021 semester due to the pandemic, but will be returning to classes in the Fall 2021 term.
