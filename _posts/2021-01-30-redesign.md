Today I pushed the new design of this website, based on [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css) with a little help from [Pure CSS](https://purecss.io) for the columns used to make the project cards on the landing page. I've had this domain for awhile now, but the `www` subdomain remained empty until May, when I used the week between classes and my summer internship to make the first version of this portfolio site. That design was admittedly a rushed eyesore, so my hope is that this version is more readable.

The only changes are aesthetic; I still use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to build from Markdown and HTML. I want a simple, readable design that loads quickly and uses minimal JavaScript, and this site meets those requirements. The purpose of this site is to deliver information about my work and project experience, and I hope visitors will find it useful for that. I think anything more complex than a static HTML site -- whether Wordpress or React -- would be a bit much for what I'm trying to do here. Best to use the right tool for the job, not just use a tool for its own sake.

Looking forward to (maybe) publishing some more updates on this site to document my past and current work.
